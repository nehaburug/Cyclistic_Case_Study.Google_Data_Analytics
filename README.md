This case study is from Google Data Analytics on Coursera. 
In this scenario, I am a junior Data Analyst working under marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago.

The company has two types of pricing, casual(single pass or day pass riders) and member(annual membership). 
The companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 
Therefore, My task is to find out how the casual riders differ from member riders in using Cyclistic bikes. 
And based on this findings, I have my recommendations and conclusion on how the casual riders can buy the annual membership.
